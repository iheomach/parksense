## üéØ Project Overview

Smart Parking Finder is a web application that helps users locate the most cost-effective and convenient parking options near their current location. The app combines live traffic data from the Mapbox API, parking availability data, and AI-powered insights from the OpenAI API to provide intelligent parking recommendations.

### Key Features
- **AI-Powered Availability Predictions** - Uses OpenAI API for contextual reasoning about parking availability
- **Cost Estimation** - Generates approximate parking cost predictions 
- **Traffic Integration** - Real-time traffic data via Mapbox API
- **Intelligent Ranking** - Ranks nearby parking spots using geolocation and multiple criteria
- **Interactive Map Interface** - OpenStreetMap-based UI with traffic overlays

## üöó Use Cases

### 1. Concert/Sports Game Parking
A driver heading to a concert or sports game in San Francisco uses the app to request the five most cost-effective parking options within one mile of the venue. The system combines Mapbox data with OpenAI reasoning to assess likely availability around high-demand event areas, factors in estimated parking costs, and presents the driver with a ranked list of the best low-cost options.

### 2. Everyday Commuting
A commuter driving to work wants the lowest-cost parking near their office. The app uses Mapbox to identify congestion, applies OpenAI reasoning to determine intuitive availability, and shows the cheapest viable spots within walking distance.
